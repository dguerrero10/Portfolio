    <p>Is this where time ends?</p>
    <p>Memory is so shapeless.</p>
    <p>I only know that it must’ve been a dream,</p>
    <p>or was it a lifetime? All the clocks stopped</p>
    <p>after a while (however long it was) --</p>
    <p>I’m sorry, but how could I forget your name?</p>
    <p>I just remember that we sat along the water,</p>
    <p>and it was so quiet there, we could hear</p>
    <p>the humming of atoms.</p>
    <p>Perhaps, we can start over.</p>
    <p>You still live across the way, no?</p>
    <p>I can meet you there.</p>
    <p>We’ll drink and laugh the night away.</p>
    <p>And do as we always did</p>
    <p>in the early morning and push the boat out</p>
    <p>from off the sand. We’ll sit and think,</p>
    <p>and ask the same silly questions</p>
    <p>again and again,</p>
    <p>like where’s all the fish at?</p>
    <p>Are we dead?</p>`
